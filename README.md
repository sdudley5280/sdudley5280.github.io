# Technical Leader Portfolio (React + TypeScript + Vite)

This is a minimal portfolio scaffold intended for a technical leader — focused on a clear narrative: leadership, strategy, key projects, and contact info.

Getting started:
1. Install dependencies:
   npm install

2. Run dev server:
   npm run dev

3. Build:
   npm run build

Branch/Deploy:
- I recommend creating a branch named `site/react-ts` and pushing the files there.
- CI workflow (provided) will build and deploy to GitHub Pages automatically after push.

Customize:
- Replace the copy in `src/components/*` with your content.
- Add images, GitHub projects, and links where appropriate.

Notes:
- This project uses Vite + React + TypeScript.
